We are called by our collective spiritual and social responsibility to serve all people in needâ€”the homeless, disadvantaged, disabled, unemployed, and oppressed. Our goal is to enhance societal and personal advancement through provision of housing and support services that empower individuals and families to reach their fullest potential.

Emmaus helps people rebuild their lives by creating and renewing a sense of community.  Emmaus purchased its first property in 1986 for use as an emergency shelter. Since that time, the organization was launched into affordable housing development, including Gilead House,  the George C. Wadleigh Center,  Mitchâ€™s Place, Jericho House Safe Haven, Bethel Business Center, and the Housing Assistance/Stabilization Program. Following projects included the Emerson Street Shelter Plus Care Project, Emmaus Family, the Applewood Apartments, Evergreen Place, 115 Emerson Street, 101 Winter Street and additonal units.  Over the past decade, Emmaus has consistently received statewide recognition for moving the greatest number of homeless families out of emergency shelter and into permanent housing, Last year alone, Emmaus placed 150 families into permanent housing and diverted another 300 high-risk families from entering emergency shelter by stabilizing them in their current housing or finding them new housing.'

Established in Lawrence, VNOC started as a storefront operation, staffed largely by volunteers, to provide support and advocacy to Vietnam Veterans. Through the years, the focus of the Center has expanded to accommodate over 50,000 Veterans in our region who are eligible for care. We provide a continuum of care to Veterans, their families, from the very basic food and shelter needs to advocacy, information, referral, career, and education services. VNOC also sponsors a number of outreach initiatives to Veterans of all eras and families of Veterans. The Center is funded, in part, through contracts with Department of Veterans Affairs, Mass. Department of Veterans Services, US Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, and private donations.'

Both agencies have continuously expanded services, creating new housing options and providing a wide variety of supportive services for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities or other significant challenges. In 2019, Fidelity House, Inc. and CRC merged into one organization for the purpose of further enhancing services, improving efficiency and increasing the capacity for future innovation.'
